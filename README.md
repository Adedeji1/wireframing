## What is Wireframing?

**Wireframing** is the process of creating a simple visual guide that outlines the structure, layout, and functionality of a user interface or webpage. It focuses on **what goes where** — showing the placement of elements like buttons, images, text, and navigation — without worrying about design details like color, fonts, or graphics.

Wireframes are usually created in black and white or grayscale to keep attention on layout and functionality.

##  Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing is a crucial first step in UI/UX and web/app development because it:

- **Clarifies ideas** early, helping stakeholders and teams visualize the product.
- **Improves communication** between designers, developers, and clients.
- **Identifies usability issues** before any code is written.
- **Speeds up iteration**, saving time and resources during development.
- **Validates functionality**, ensuring the structure supports user goals.

## What's in This Repository?

This repository will include:

- Low-fidelity wireframes (sketches or basic layouts)
- High-fidelity wireframes (detailed UI mockups)
- Notes and design decisions made during the process

Stay tuned as this project evolves!
