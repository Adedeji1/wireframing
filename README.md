## What is Wireframing?

**Wireframing** is the process of creating a simple visual guide that outlines the structure, layout, and functionality of a user interface or webpage. It focuses on **what goes where** — showing the placement of elements like buttons, images, text, and navigation — without worrying about design details like color, fonts, or graphics.

Wireframes are usually created in black and white or grayscale to keep attention on layout and functionality.

##  Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing is a crucial first step in UI/UX and web/app development because it:

- **Clarifies ideas** early, helping stakeholders and teams visualize the product.
- **Improves communication** between designers, developers, and clients.
- **Identifies usability issues** before any code is written.
- **Speeds up iteration**, saving time and resources during development.
- **Validates functionality**, ensuring the structure supports user goals.

## What's in This Repository?

This repository will include:

- Low-fidelity wireframes (sketches or basic layouts)
- High-fidelity wireframes (detailed UI mockups)
- Notes and design decisions made during the process

Stay tuned as this project evolves!



## Key Elements of a Wireframe

Wireframes focus on **structure and functionality** rather than visual design. Here are the essential elements commonly found in a wireframe and how they contribute to the overall design:

### 1.  Layout Structure

Defines the overall framework or skeleton of the page — how sections are arranged (e.g., header, sidebar, main content, footer).

**Example:**  
Placing the navigation bar at the top and content in a two-column layout helps users easily scan and access information.

---

### 2. Navigation

Shows how users move between pages or sections of the interface. It includes menus, tabs, breadcrumbs, and links.

**Example:**  
A top navigation menu with links like "Home | Services | Book Now | Contact" ensures users can quickly access key sections.

---

### 3. Content Placement

Outlines where text, images, buttons, and other UI elements will appear on the page.

**Example:**  
Positioning a “Book Now” button prominently on the homepage increases visibility and encourages user action.

---

### 4. Functionality

Represents interactive elements and how they are expected to behave (e.g., search bars, dropdowns, forms, buttons).

**Example:**  
A wireframe showing a form with input fields and a “Submit” button indicates that users can fill in booking details and complete an action.

These elements help communicate the structure and purpose of a design early in the process — ensuring alignment between teams before development begins.
